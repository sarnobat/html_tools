4) Habbu Narayana Rao Raghavendra 


Founder of the famous Usha Publications of Mysore, Habbu Narayana Rao Raghavendra was born at Nimbal, near Bijapur in 1914. He came to Dharwad to join G.B.Joshi, founder of the famous Manohara Granthamale. Later, Habbu moved over to Mysore with Joshi and started the Usha Press in 1943 and publication of works written by leading writers in Kannada. Usha Sahitya Male publications included works of authors like Ram.Shri. Mugali, Shriranga, Betageri Krishna Sharma, K.V.Raghavachar, V.M.Inamdar, V.Seetharamayya, H.M.Nayak, V.K.Gokak, Dr.G.Varadaraja Rao, Kerur Vasudevachar, Prof. S.V.Parameswara Bhat and Mirji Anna Rao. 


Whenever many of these writers came to Mysore, the house of Habbu in then Halladakeri was the guest house to complete or supervise printing of their works. Habbu was also response for starting the Nrupathunga Samskrithika Sangha in association with late Hindustani musician Hunagund. Hindustani music concerts were an annual feature of the association. Habbu passed away in 1990. His son H.R.Ramesh, who took up the mantle, died a decade later in 2000, with which the Usha Publications also had to be shutdown. To perpetuate Habbu's memory, his daughters and nearest kins have instituted the endowment in the Sahitya Parishat.
